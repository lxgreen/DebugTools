      Gen0
        Object
          *Link to Type
      Gen1
        Object
          *Link to Type
      Gen2
        Object
          *Link to Type
    LOH
      Object
        *Link to Type
      
  Stacks

      *Link to Method
    
  FinalizationQueue
    Object
      *Link to type
    
  AppDomain

      Module
        Type
          Handle (if relevant)

2. DumpDiff gets 2 dumps and returns the diff of the object allocated on heaps

3. DetectDeadlocks detects deadlocks caused by Monitor locks. Relies on SyncBlock and thread info.
